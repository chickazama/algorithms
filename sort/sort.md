# Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

The most frequently used orderings are numerical or lexicographical.

Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

1. The output is in monotonic order - i.e. each element when compared with the
previous element does not violate the ordering.

2. The output is a permutation - i.e. all the data from the input is re-ordered,
with no missing elements.

## Implementation Information

All of the sorting algorithms implemented here take in the array of command-line
arguments as the input data. Each argument is parsed into a 32-bit integer, and
then sorted in ascending order.
